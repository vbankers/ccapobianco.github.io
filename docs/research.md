    <div class="timeline-desc"> Acquired and post-processed 7T QSM-MRI images in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice and controls in a
longitudinal (4-18 months) study on Alzheimer’s Disease. Analyzed results and created a novel atlas of mice brains to conclude AD and age-related gray-matter changes and Doxycycline’s long-lasting plaque-reducing effects. Used Matlab and common biomedical imaging software. </div>
